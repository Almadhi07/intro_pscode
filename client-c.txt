# Client Task C #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
n the "Product Package Counter" program, the goal is to count the number of packages a hardware device 
scans for boxing into cases. 
Each package contains two products, and each case can hold a maximum of 50 packages. 
The program uses a loop to print the number of products scanned, starting from 2 and counting up to 50, 
incrementing by twos. 
With each iteration, the program adds two to the previous number, representing the number 
of products scanned and packed into cases. 
The loop continues until the total reaches 50 products, at which point the program stops.
