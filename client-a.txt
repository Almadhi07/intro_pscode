Welcome to the guessing number game!

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10. 
The player is given 3 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the player's input is checked against the chosen number. 
If the player's guess is correct, a message is displayed congratulating them, and the game ends. 
If the guess is incorrect, the player is informed of the number of remaining attempts. T
he game continues until the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts. 
If the player uses all 3 guesses without success, 
the game reveals the correct number and displays a "game over" message.
