# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #

the customer starts at a specific location in a large warehouse and is trying to find a predetermined target location. 
The warehouse is represented as a grid, and the customer can move in four directions: 
north, south, east, or west. 
The customer's current position and the target location are tracked using variables 
representing their coordinates on the grid. 
A loop repeatedly checks the customerâ€™s current location against the target location. 
fter each movement (north, south, east, or west), the coordinates are updated, 
and the application gives feedback on how far the customer is from the target. 
The loop continues until the customer reaches the target location, 
at which point the application displays a success message.
